# Adding Accesabiltity to Horiseon

## Changes to Code

In this project I added accessability options for screen readers using
'alt' tags in html. Those following images in the "content" section were given descriptors.
Those found in the "benefit" section were left blank to reflect simple images.

In addition, I tidied up similar classes in the CSS to cut down on bulk and streamline reading.
Some unimportant CSS was removed as well, to no detriment to the page.

Where I was able, I changed some 'div' parents to 'section', 'header', 'footer', and 'article'
when appropriate.

Added appropriate 'title' to html
